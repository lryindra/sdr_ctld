Notes on Audio:
Ubuntu ships with with PulseAudio by default.
WSJT-X and the WSPR protocol use the System time to find messages bellow the
noise floor.  System time must be accurate (with in 1 second, i think) in order for WSPR to work.  One way to check your system time is the website
https://time.is/ But Ubuntu will run Network Time Protocol (NTP) when it
boots.

With both WSJT-X and JS8Call and sdr_ctld all sending audio through
PulseAudio, I was seeing 3 seconds of audio delay on which ever (WSJT-X or
JS8Call) application I opened second.  

First I created loopback by adding 
    sudo modprobe snd-aloop pcm_substreams=2
to a script that gets called when the system boots.  This creates Loopback.

I changed the .asoundrc to the following (at end of this document) and then I changed sdr_ctld to use default audio (ALSA) 

This appears to fix the audio delay.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
add the following to .asoundrc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# playback PCM device 
pcm.amix {
  type dmix
  ipc_key 1234
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,0"
}
# capture PCM device
pcm.asnoop {
  type dsnoop
  ipc_key 1235
  slave.pcm "hw:Loopback,0,1"
}
# duplex devcie combinding asnoop and amix
pcm.aduplex {
  type asym
  playback.pcm "amix"
  capture.pcm "asnoop"
  hint {
    show on
    description "combines loopback asnoop(input) and amix(output)"
  }
}
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm "aduplex"
}
